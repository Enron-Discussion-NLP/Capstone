      "market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, \n",
      "offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were \n",
      "bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index \n",

      "Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \n",
      "firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a \n",
      "trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas \n",

      "\n",
      " 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater \n",
      "than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. \n",

      " 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & \n",

Exodus is now wrapping up \\nconstruction\\n                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than \\na mile from its\\n                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several \\nfiber optic backbones, the\\n                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \\neventually\\n                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \\nMicrosoft and Onvia.com. \\n\\n                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data \\ncenters near Seattle.\\n                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \\nGlobix and\\n                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \\nthe networking\\n                  equipment of the Internet economy. \\n\\n                       It is a big business that could have an effect on \\neverything from your\\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \\nyour favorite Web sites.\\n\\n                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \\nserver farms, are\\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \\nValley that some\\n                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \\nPuget Sound\\n                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \\nhigh-security\\n                  facilities. \\n\\n                       \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \\nare requesting 445\\n                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" \\nsaid Karl\\n                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \\nEnergy. \"That is\\n                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" \\n\\n                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \\nthe rise of the Internet\\n                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their \\nheads. \\n\\n                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington \\nUtilities and\\n                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new \\ndata centers. The\\n                  tariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existing \\nresidential and business\\n                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \\nnecessary to support\\n                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 \\nmillion each,\\n                  Karzmar said. \\n\\n                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to \\nbring up the data center\\n                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. \\n\\n                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, \\nbusinesses and schools in the\\n                  region, this is a new and complex issue. \\n\\n                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \\nappetite for power --\\n                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The \\nfacilities run 24 hours a\\n                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a \\nconstant revenue\\n                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that \\nthey could\\n                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \\nexpenditures. \\n\\n                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will \\nmean for power rates\\n                  in the area is still open to debate. \\n\\n                       \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense \\nloads,\" said Bob Royer,\\n                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle \\nCity Light. \\n\\n                       \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium \\nlights at the football\\n                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. \\nWe have data\\n                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 \\nand 50 megawatts.\" \\n\\n                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate \\ncomplex in Tukwila is\\n                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased \\nthe 1.35 million\\n                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from \\nBoeing Space &\\n                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased \\n92 percent of the\\n                  six-building complex to seven different co-location \\ncompanies. \\n\\n                       \"It is probably the largest data center park in the \\ncountry,\" boasts Laurent\\n                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG \\nCommunications,\\n                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama \\nNetworks all\\n                  lease space in the office park. \\n\\n                       After building Exodus\\' first Tukwila facility in 1997, \\nSabey has become an\\n                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under \\nmanagement or\\n                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole \\nclaims his firm is\\n                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \\nthe country. \\n\\n                       As more people access the Internet and conduct \\nbandwidth-heavy tasks\\n                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \\nco-location space in\\n                  Seattle continues to escalate. \\n\\n                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \\nspace is growing at a\\n                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \\ncausing similar\\n                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \\nCalifornia. \\n\\n                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \\nspace, plans to nearly\\n                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \\nWhile companies\\n                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \\nhigh-tech companies\\n                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \\nas Exodus that\\n                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \\nmanagement. \\n\\n                       \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \\nconstruction and we plan to\\n                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \\ndemand right now\\n                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \\nexecutive at Exodus in\\n                  Seattle. \\n\\n                       The booming market for co-location space has left some \\nin the local utility\\n                  industry perplexed. \\n\\n                       \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \\nto serve the growth,\"\\n                  said Seattle City Light\\'s Royer. \"The utility industry is \\nalmost stunned by this, in\\n                  a way.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
