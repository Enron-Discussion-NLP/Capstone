Crocker\" \\n<clclegal2@aol.com> \\nSubject: Investment Structure\\n\\n\\nSTRUCTURE:\\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\nliability of construction.\\n\\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits\\nis reduced.\\n\\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\nnon-recourse.\\n\\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n\\nEARLY LAND COSTS\\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n\\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n\\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at\\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n\\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\nstandpoint.\\n\\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n\\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\\n\\nDISBURSEMENTS\\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n\\nREPORTING\\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\\nreporting.\\n\\nBOOKKEEPING\\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\\n\\nINVESTOR INPUT\\nWe are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.  As always\\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\\neffort to be accommodating.\\n\\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\\n\\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\\nprovide these if you are interested.\\n\\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

As you can tell from the proforma this project\\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\\npreferences.\\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\\nif she will be ok in the long run.\\nGeorge W.

Sitting at the confluence of several \\nfiber optic backbones, the\\n                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \\neventually\\n                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \\nMicrosoft and Onvia.com. \\n\\n                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data \\ncenters near Seattle.\\n                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \\nGlobix and\\n                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \\nthe networking\\n                  equipment of the Internet economy. \\n\\n                       It is a big business that could have an effect on \\neverything from your\\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \\nyour favorite Web sites.\\n\\n                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \\nserver farms, are\\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \\nValley that some\\n                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \\nPuget Sound\\n                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \\nhigh-security\\n                  facilities. \\n\\n                       \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \\nare requesting 445\\n                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" \\nsaid Karl\\n                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \\nEnergy. \"That is\\n                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" \\n\\n                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \\nthe rise of the Internet\\n                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their \\nheads. \\n\\n                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington \\nUtilities and\\n                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new \\ndata centers. The\\n                  tariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existing \\nresidential and business\\n                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \\nnecessary to support\\n                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 \\nmillion each,\\n                  Karzmar said. \\n\\n                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to \\nbring up the data center\\n                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. \\n\\n                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, \\nbusinesses and schools in the\\n                  region, this is a new and complex issue. \\n\\n                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \\nappetite for power --\\n                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The \\nfacilities run 24 hours a\\n                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a \\nconstant revenue\\n                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that \\nthey could\\n                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \\nexpenditures. \\n\\n                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will \\nmean for power rates\\n                  in the area is still open to debate. \\n\\n                       \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense \\nloads,\" said Bob Royer,\\n                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle \\nCity Light. \\n\\n                       \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium \\nlights at the football\\n                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. \\nWe have data\\n                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 \\nand 50 megawatts.\" \\n\\n                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate \\ncomplex in Tukwila is\\n                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased \\nthe 1.35 million\\n                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from \\nBoeing Space &\\n                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased \\n92 percent of the\\n                  six-building complex to seven different co-location \\ncompanies. \\n\\n                       \"It is probably the largest data center park in the \\ncountry,\" boasts Laurent\\n                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG \\nCommunications,\\n                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama \\nNetworks all\\n                  lease space in the office park. \\n\\n                       After building Exodus\\' first Tukwila facility in 1997, \\nSabey has become an\\n                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under \\nmanagement or\\n                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole \\nclaims his firm is\\n                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \\nthe country. \\n\\n                       As more people access the Internet and conduct \\nbandwidth-heavy tasks\\n                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \\nco-location space in\\n                  Seattle continues to escalate. \\n\\n                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \\nspace is growing at a\\n                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \\ncausing similar\\n                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \\nCalifornia. \\n\\n                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \\nspace, plans to nearly\\n                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \\nWhile companies\\n                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \\nhigh-tech companies\\n                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \\nas Exodus that\\n                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \\nmanagement. \\n\\n                       \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \\nconstruction and we plan to\\n                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \\ndemand right now\\n                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \\nexecutive at Exodus in\\n                  Seattle. \\n\\n                       The booming market for co-location space has left some \\nin the local utility\\n                  industry perplexed. \\n\\n                       \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \\nto serve the growth,\"\\n                  said Seattle City Light\\'s Royer. \"The utility industry is \\nalmost stunned by this, in\\n                  a way.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The \\nWSCC data, which is dicey and we don\\'t have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \\nwhich comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \\nthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \\nthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \\ngeneration.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn\\'t schedule their \\ngeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \\nwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \\nmunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \\nif they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \\nschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \\nall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \\nthe generation side.\\n\\nOn the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \\nthey don\\'t split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \\nbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \\nload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\\n\\nI think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \\nothers up here once you have it finished.  I\\'d like to see how much gas \\ndemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \\nespecially compared to all gas consumption.

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \\nan issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is \\nO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to \\nget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \\nI'll take care of it..\\n\\nOn PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \\ncurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \\n$235,019.   \\n(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \\noverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \\nsomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \\n#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\\n  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)\\n  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)\\n  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)\\n  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)\\n  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)\\n Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \\nGDP-Kingsgate.\\n\\n Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \\ndifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \\nwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a \\nQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is \\nthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \\nlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  \\nI'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \\nsystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems \\nthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \\nthe transport cost would pass through as storage costs.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\\n\\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable\\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California\\'s problems to the West\\n\\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it\\'s a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

Any possibility for a \\ndeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans \\nand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is \\nreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and \\nDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the \\nbonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into \\nthe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and \\nthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of \\nthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  \\nAdditionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term \\npower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the \\nbond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of \\ncontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge \\nloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very \\ndifficult.\\n\\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state \\nwould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General \\nFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 \\nbillion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this \\nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full \\ndisclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the \\ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they \\nwill support the bond issuance to go forward.\\n\\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB \\n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill \\npassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of \\nRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for \\ncommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be \\namended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, \\ncurrently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state should \\nget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be \\nlikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \\n \\nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, \\nRepublicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money \\navailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated \\nthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  \\nOther Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The \\nRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, \\nLehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and \\nthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\\n \\nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\\nInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 B\\nLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B\\n   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B\\n   Bear Stearns  $625 M\\nTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\\nProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%\\n   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%\\nCurrent Projected \\nBlended IR:  5.38%\\nMaturity Date:  August 29, 2001\\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\\n\\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the \\nCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion \\nauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be \\nauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the \\nadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing \\npower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these \\nauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the \\ngovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond \\namount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to \\nsupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB \\n6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  \\nfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  \\nthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  \\nbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this \\nidea  earlier in the crisis.\\n \\nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The \\nfirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the \\ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is \\nAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According \\nto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has \\nsigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis \\nand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates \\nthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary \\nbankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \\n\\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond \\nissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) \\nstating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, \\nthen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the \\nstate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and \\npassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for \\nbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and \\nthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.\\n\\n',\n",

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \\nMarch 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \\nover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \\ntemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \\ninto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \\ncompared with the previous year.\\n\\nLooking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \\nreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \\nforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \\ntotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \\nThis scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \\nmore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \\ndecrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \\nretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \\nis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \\nyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \\nJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \\nare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \\nmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \\neconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \\nmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\\n\\nNote that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \\nonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \\n(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \\nportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \\ndemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \\nyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \\nsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \\nleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \\nwish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \\nmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \\nsharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \\nhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \\nOther large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif\\'s \\neconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \\nthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \\nthink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \\nrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \\nnon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \\nWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \\n6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\\n\\nI am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you \\nwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I \\nhope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \\nquestions or need any further information.\\n',\n",

soon.\\n\\nEmployees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new \\nbuilding and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being \\noffered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.\\n\\nThis is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the \\nnew garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The \\ncost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is \\ncurrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly \\nemployee cost of $94.00.\\n\\nIf you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to \\nthe Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made \\nas spaces become available. \\n\\nThe Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be \\nopened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street \\nlevel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. \\nGarage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an \\nexit in the event of elevator trouble. \\n\\nIf you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to \\nParking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your \\nemail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and \\nreceive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new \\ngarage.\\n\\nThe Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and \\nTransportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. \\n\\n(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, \\nwill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which \\ncurrent unpaid invoices due total $37,325.\\n\\nActing in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this \\nproject for more than five months and have completed most of the major design \\nand other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of \\nour size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or \\nrejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? \\n\\nTwo methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a \\npercentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on \\nyour prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, \\nor $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the \\nsecond, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per \\nyear, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these \\nvaluations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the \\nforfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in \\nthe hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future \\nprojects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per \\nmonth to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the \\nattached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings \\nthe total net buyout to $78,946.? \\n\\nWe still believe that this project needs the professional services that we \\noffer and have provided.?

The property is \\nstill in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot \\nand is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a \\ntopographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to \\ncoordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the \\nsmaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going \\nto fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to \\ncomplete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which \\n$14,000 are due now for work completed.  \\n\\nWe are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by \\nthe original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can \\ncontinue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's \\nnumber is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and \\nask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call \\nand he was fine with that.  \\n\\nNow we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp \\nFlores can be used.\\n\\nKeith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which \\ncurrent unpaid invoices due total $37,325.\\n\\nActing in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this \\nproject for more than five months and have completed most of the major design \\nand other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of \\nour size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or \\nrejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? \\n\\nTwo methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a \\npercentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on \\nyour prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, \\nor $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the \\nsecond, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per \\nyear, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these \\nvaluations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the \\nforfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in \\nthe hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future \\nprojects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per \\nmonth to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the \\nattached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings \\nthe total net buyout to $78,946.? \\n\\nWe still believe that this project needs the professional services that we \\noffer and have provided.?

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the\\nproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a\\nnumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward\\non the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a\\nBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted\\npro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are\\nacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about \\n500+\\nunits coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, \\nthis,\\nwe believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious\\neffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested\\nloan amount to $8,868,000.\\n\\nI have summarized our issues as follows:\\n\\n1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:\\n\\n     Pro-Forma                           Bank\\'s Adjustment\\n     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR\\n     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475\\n     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417\\n\\n2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit\\nturn over.\\n\\n3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).\\n\\n4.  Based on the Bank\\'s revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support\\ndebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x \\ndebt\\ncoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.\\n\\n5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.\\n\\n6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide\\nequity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:\\n\\n     Land -                   $1,121,670\\n     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000\\n     Cash Equity              $1,419,268\\n     Total                    $2,955,938\\n\\n7.

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia\\nHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest\\nregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid\\nabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.\\nBut that still wasn\\'t enough juice.\\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts\\nof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of\\n$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts\\nof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the\\n$250/MWh price cap.\\nThe LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The\\nmunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power\\ninto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP\\nis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit\\nclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville\\nPower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the\\nmarket at prices 10 times higher.\\nPowerex officials wouldn\\'t comment on the ISO power sale, saying all\\ntransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000\\nmegawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts\\n- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.\\nThe ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state\\nno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,\\nwhich means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having\\nto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing\\nto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.\\nThe ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during\\na conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency\\nWednesday, but wouldn\\'t order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared\\nwhen the ISO\\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is\\ninterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.\\nBut ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as\\na means of attracting additional electricity resources.\\n\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"\\nDorinson said.\\nEdison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy\\nunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &\\nElectric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of\\nthe high-priced power.\\nSoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high\\nwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by\\nnearly $1 billion, analysts said. It\\'s still unclear whether retail\\ncustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity\\nrates or if companies will absorb the costs.\\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\\njason.leopold@dowjones.com\\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\\n1318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\\n13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay\\nPwr Plant\\n(This article was originally published Wednesday)\\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent\\nSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy\\nCorp.\\'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,\\nWednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.\\nThe ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state\\nsince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the\\nreasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\\nAbout 11,000 MW of power has been off the state\\'s power grid since Monday,\\n7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the\\nISO.\\nThe ISO manages grid reliability.\\nAs previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy\\nRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert\\nat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would\\ndip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid\\ncollapse.

They were taken down\\ntwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality\\nManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,\\nThomas said.\\nAES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire\\nHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos\\nand Redondo Beach plants.\\nThe ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES\\nhas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the\\ncompany $20 million for polluting.\\n\"We\\'d be happy to put our units back, provided we don\\'t get sued for it,\"\\nThomas said. \"It\\'s not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality\\ndistrict\\'s\" authority.\\nAs reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES\\ncould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off\\nline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.\\n\\n   Dynegy\\'s El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC\\n\\nDynegy Inc.

What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite \\nmanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has \\ninterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager \\nthat could do more make readies and lawn care.

Cash Needs\\nHighlights:\\nSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=\\nplete=20\\ncash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20\\nprogram of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=\\ns=20\\nand other measures.=20\\nBased on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20\\navailable cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=\\n.8=20\\nmillion to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20\\nconservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.\\nII. Credit Relationships\\nHighlights:\\nSCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20\\nextend or renew credit as it has become due.\\nAt present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.\\nSCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=\\nlt.=20\\nGenerally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=\\nnd=20\\npayable.\\nSCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=\\n=20\\nindebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20\\nindebtedness if it were feasible to do so.\\nCredit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =\\nits=20\\nrated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=\\n=20\\nissues within the last three weeks.\\nIII. Energy Cost Scenarios\\nHighlights\\nThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20\\nvarious price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=\\n such=20\\nscenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.\\nIV. Cost Containment Initiatives\\nHighlights\\nSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.\\nThe Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=\\n=20\\nimprovement component as follows (in millions):\\nOperating and maintenance costs     $ 77\\nCapital Improvement Costs                383\\nTotal                                             $ 460\\nThe Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=\\n=20\\nbe eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=\\nom=20\\ncontract employees.\\nUnder the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=\\n=20\\nmost part being deferred to a future date.\\nSCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20\\nexecutive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20\\nsavings of approximately $92 million.\\nV. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20\\nActivity)\\nHighlights:\\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20\\nTransition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20\\nincludes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20\\nmillion and accelerated revenues of $175 million.\\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=\\n=20\\nTransition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.\\nNormally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=\\ne=20\\nend of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=\\n=20\\nbalance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20\\nD.01-01-018.\\nCosts of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20\\ngeneration are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20\\ntracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20\\nexpressed in the TRA, are overstated.\\nTURN Proposal\\nAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=\\nRN=20\\nto change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=\\ns.=20\\nOur comments are summarized as follows:\\nThe Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=\\nt=20\\nwould not directly generate nor use cash.\\nThe Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=\\nift=20\\ncosts between two regulatory assets.\\nTURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=\\n the=20\\nrevenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =\\nin=20\\nthe TRA is overstated.\\nVI. Flow of Funds Analysis\\nHighlights:\\nIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=\\n=20\\npositive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.\\nDuring the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=\\n=20\\nits parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.\\nEdison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=\\n=20\\nshareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=\\non=20\\nstock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=\\nve=20\\nand general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.\\n[there is no Section VII]\\n=20\\nVIII. Earnings of California Affiliates\\nSCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=\\n=20\\nmillion annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20\\nIn 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=\\n=20\\nThis increase correlates to the increase in market prices\\nfor natural gas for the same period.\\nA copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20\\nwww.cpuc.ca.gov.\\n=20\\nDan\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star\\nDate: 01/20/01 22:15\\n\\nAs natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile \\nExchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas \\nstorage number. \\n\\nThe storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the \\nforecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a \\nsupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \\n\\n\"Traders do that all the time; they\\'re looking forward,\" said William Burson, \\na trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" \\n\\nBut the market\\'s response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \\nAssociation\\'s director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \\nstorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the \\nnumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than \\nreality. \\n\\n\"It\\'s a little frustrating that they don\\'t take the time to understand what \\nwe are reporting,\" McGill said. \\n\\nAs consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- \\nand culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing \\nfingers at Wall Street. \\n\\nStephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently \\nstepped before an industry conference and blamed the market\\'s speculators for \\nthe rise in gas prices. \\n\\n\"It\\'s my firm belief ... that today\\'s gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik \\ntold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. \\n\\nIn California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric \\nutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. \\n\\nCloser to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame \\nfor this winter\\'s startling gas bills, having failed to protect their \\ncustomers and constituents from such price spikes. \\n\\nMost utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take \\nprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price \\ninsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas \\nprices before they soared. \\n\\n\"We\\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul \\nSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. \\n\\nBut critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \\n\\n\"There\\'s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to \\nchange,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security \\nAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. \\n\\n\\nHot topic \\n\\nConsumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In \\nmany circles, little else is discussed. \\n\\nThe Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is \\nfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the \\nprevious December\\'s bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \\nwell. \\n\\nThe Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of \\nhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial \\npledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \\n\\n\"It\\'s the talk of the town here,\" he said. \\n\\nA year ago that wasn\\'t a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \\nthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn\\'t make it worthwhile \\nto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by \\ncustomers. \\n\\nBut trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand \\ncubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage \\nfor winter. \\n\\nThere was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, \\nprices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information \\nAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating \\nbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. \\n\\nBut $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, \\nincluding the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas \\nmarkets. \\n\\n\"It\\'s all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. \\n\\nWholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York \\ntraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile \\ncommodity in the world. \\n\\n\\nSetting the price \\n\\nIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of \\ngas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading \\ncontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had \\nwidespread influence over gas prices. \\n\\nThe futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon \\nas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale \\nprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from \\nutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what \\nthey pay for the gas they expect to use. \\n\\nThere are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention \\nof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge \\nof natural gas. \\n\\nBut if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don\\'t need to \\nknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they\\'re trading. Like all \\nfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to \\ntheir volatility and to the traders\\' ability to make or lose a lot of money \\nin a short time. \\n\\nAs December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less \\nthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. \\nMuch of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association\\'s \\nweekly storage numbers. \\n\\nUtilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to \\nneed in the winter. \\n\\nGoing into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than \\naverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in \\nhopes that the summer\\'s unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. \\n\\nStill, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be \\nsufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the \\nconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. \\n\\nThen the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage \\nnumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the \\nassociation\\'s McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \\n\\nBut some utility executives didn\\'t share that view. William Eliason, vice \\npresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December\\'s cold snap had \\ncontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \\n\\n\"I was getting worried,\" he said. \\n\\nThen suddenly the market turned when January\\'s weather turned warmer. \\nWednesday\\'s storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \\ndropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. \\n\\n\\nJust passing through \\n\\nSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but \\npass their fuel costs on to customers. \\n\\nAmong area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers\\' cost-of-gas \\ncharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas \\nEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. \\n\\nSheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last \\nmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could \\nbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve \\nenergy. \\n\\nKansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to \\nsave an average customer about $25 this winter. \\n\\nMissouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an \\nextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not \\nguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. \\n\\nNow utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left \\ncustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether \\nthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel \\ncosts. \\n\\nOn Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public \\nCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to \\nperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy\\'s gas purchasing practices. \\n\\n\"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It\\'s time to consider \\nsome changes.\" \\n\\n\\nTo reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to \\nseverly@kcstar.com. \\n\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n--\\nAll content , 2001 The Kansas City Star  ',\n",

In attendance were Ken Lay, \\nthe Governor, the Governor\\'s staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. \\nspent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his \\nideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next \\nweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  \\nAttached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on \\nmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff \\nDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our \\nproposals, the governor\\'s ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \\nbased on the governor\\'s comments:\\n\\nOverview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that \\nwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \\ncommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \\ngo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \\nthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \\nwork to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \\ntalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \\nlevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \\nbenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \\nwould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \\n(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \\nsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \\nthe problem by \\'02 and provide some political cover.\\nOur proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \\nincluded the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \\ninterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \\ngoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \\nto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \\nanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \\nincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \\nHe was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \\npurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \\nsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\\nHis ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \\nunder serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \\nSome of these ideas would require legislative action.\\nState may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \\ngeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that \\nthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This \\nwas a frequently recurring theme.\\nUtilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus \\nbasis to consumers.\\nMunicipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in \\nCalifornia.\\nState universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more \\nwidely deploy distributed generation.\\nExpand in-state gas production.\\nTake state lands gas royalties in kind.\\nnegotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for \\naddtional gas supplies.\\nEmpower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant \\nmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at \\nany one time.\\nCondition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.\\nEither eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear \\nmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder\\'s group should be \\nable to help out here).\\nWants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made \\nsome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy \\nsome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation \\nthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control \\napproach with generators.\\nSecuritize uncollected power purchase costs.\\nTo dos: (Jeff, again I\\'d like to prevail on you to assemble the group\\'s \\nthoughts and get them to Kari)\\nHe wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- \\nnot just the 5 one year strips.\\nHe wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.\\nHe would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the \\ndeal.\\nHe wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the \\nforward contracting issues.\\nThanks to everyone for their help.

If \\nyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs far as recommendations, here is a short list:\\n\\n 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales \\nabove monthly index without enough consideration of future \\n      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be \\ninjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.\\n                    This creates a shortage in later months.\\n\\n 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet \\ndemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  \\n                      Specific questions should include:  \\n\\n  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order \\nto fill storage?\\n\\n  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too \\nmuch gas from Socal's system.  \\n       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their \\nown demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than \\ntheir injection capablity, but injected far less.\\n\\n 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short \\nterm prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major \\n                    LDCs.

Note that the\\nconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our\\nstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio\\nof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.\\n\\nAlso, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs\\nare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have\\nactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf\\nwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.\\n\\nIt appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.

The rental rates that we project are\\n$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3\\nbedroom.

Any possibility for a=\\n deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=\\nans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=\\nus is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=\\nans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=\\nnce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double=\\n dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=\\nislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=\\ne details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=\\ne.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=\\ng-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=\\nhat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =\\nbreach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=\\ne bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=\\nll be very difficult.\\n\\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=\\ne would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=\\n Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =\\n$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =\\nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=\\nl disclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the =\\ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=\\n will support the bond issuance to go forward.\\n\\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =\\n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=\\nll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=\\nk of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=\\nr community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=\\nended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=\\nntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state should get =\\npaid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=\\nkely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20\\n=20\\nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=\\nans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =\\nthe General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =\\nof the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=\\nicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=\\n to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=\\nrtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=\\nications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\\n=20\\nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\\nInitial Loan Amount:=09$4.125 B\\nLenders:=09=09JP Morgan=09=09$2.5 B\\n=09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B\\n=09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 M\\nTax Exempt Portion:=09Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\\nProjected Interest Rate:=09Taxable Rate=09=095.77%\\n=09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77%\\nCurrent Projected=20\\nBlended IR:=09=095.38%\\nMaturity Date:=09=09August 29, 2001\\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\\n\\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=\\nhe California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=\\n authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=\\nhorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=\\ntional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =\\ngoing forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=\\nations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =\\nhas  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =\\nthat must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=\\nurther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =\\nis clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=\\ning power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=\\nornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=\\ndered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=\\nier in the crisis.\\n=20\\nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=\\nhe first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =\\ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=\\ngust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=\\no sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=\\nigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=\\ns and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=\\nes that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=\\nruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20\\n\\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=\\nsuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=\\ntating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=\\nen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=\\nate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=\\nassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=\\n bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=\\n the DWR proportionately from rate payments.\\n\\n',\n",

Crocker\" \\n<clclegal2@aol.com> \\nSubject: Investment Structure\\n\\n\\nSTRUCTURE:\\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\nliability of construction.\\n\\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits\\nis reduced.\\n\\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\nnon-recourse.\\n\\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n\\nEARLY LAND COSTS\\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n\\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n\\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at\\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n\\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\nstandpoint.\\n\\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n\\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\\n\\nDISBURSEMENTS\\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n\\nREPORTING\\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\\nreporting.\\n\\nBOOKKEEPING\\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\\n\\nINVESTOR INPUT\\nWe are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.  As always\\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\\neffort to be accommodating.\\n\\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\\n\\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\\nprovide these if you are interested.\\n\\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call\\nwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nGeorge Richards\\nPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n - winmail.dat\\n',\n",

It appears that a single \\nbuyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above \\nmarket prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, \\noffers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were \\nbypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index \\ncalculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated \\nfinancial swaps for San Juan.\\n\\n We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \\nSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from \\nEnron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \\nfirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a \\ntrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas \\ndaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread \\nrelationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:\\n\\n 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater \\nthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. \\n\\n 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & \\nNorthwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and \\n       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that \\nare dramatically different.\\n\\n\\n I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the \\ntrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to \\ndetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are \\noutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in \\nestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at \\n$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the \\ncalculation of index.\\n\\n It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to \\nconduct our physical and financial business.

A single buyer entered the \\nmarketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices \\n($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the \\ntime of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 \\ncents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to \\nreport into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of \\nline with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.\\n\\n We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \\nSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from \\nEnron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \\nfirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a \\ntrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas \\ndaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread \\nrelationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:\\n\\n 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater \\nthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. \\n\\n 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & \\nNorthwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and \\n       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that \\nare dramatically different.\\n\\n\\n I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the \\ntrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to \\ndetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are \\noutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in \\nestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at \\n$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the \\ncalculation of index.\\n\\n It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to \\nconduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me \\nanytime I can assist you towards this goal.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nPhillip Allen\\n\",\n",

Crocker\" \\n<clclegal2@aol.com> \\nSubject: Investment Structure\\n\\n\\nSTRUCTURE:\\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\nliability of construction.\\n\\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits\\nis reduced.\\n\\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\nnon-recourse.\\n\\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n\\nEARLY LAND COSTS\\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n\\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n\\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at\\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n\\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\nstandpoint.\\n\\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n\\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\\n\\nDISBURSEMENTS\\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n\\nREPORTING\\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\\nreporting.\\n\\nBOOKKEEPING\\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\\n\\nINVESTOR INPUT\\nWe are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.  As always\\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\\neffort to be accommodating.\\n\\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\\n\\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\\nprovide these if you are interested.\\n\\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last \\nnight but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said \\nthis is out of his area but doesn\\'t  sound binding to him.? \\n?\\nI will go back to mine and Phillip Allen\\'s  transaction?and take a look at \\nthat but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even \\nneeded to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any \\nneed to contact me regarding the  closing.\\n?\\nI really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself \\nand I don\\'t want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn\\'t \\nseem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my \\nsignature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it \\nreviewed before I accept it.\\n?\\nBrenda\\n?\\n?\\n',\n",

As you can tell from the proforma this project\\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\\npreferences.\\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.

A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\\nif she will be ok in the long run.\\nGeorge W.

Exodus is now wrapping up \\nconstruction\\n                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than \\na mile from its\\n                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several \\nfiber optic backbones, the\\n                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \\neventually\\n                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \\nMicrosoft and Onvia.com. \\n\\n                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data \\ncenters near Seattle.\\n                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \\nGlobix and\\n                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \\nthe networking\\n                  equipment of the Internet economy. \\n\\n                       It is a big business that could have an effect on \\neverything from your\\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \\nyour favorite Web sites.\\n\\n                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \\nserver farms, are\\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \\nValley that some\\n                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \\nPuget Sound\\n                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \\nhigh-security\\n                  facilities. \\n\\n                       \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \\nare requesting 445\\n                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" \\nsaid Karl\\n                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \\nEnergy. \"That is\\n                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" \\n\\n                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \\nthe rise of the Internet\\n                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their \\nheads. \\n\\n                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington \\nUtilities and\\n                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new \\ndata centers. The\\n                  tariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existing \\nresidential and business\\n                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \\nnecessary to support\\n                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 \\nmillion each,\\n                  Karzmar said. \\n\\n                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to \\nbring up the data center\\n                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. \\n\\n                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, \\nbusinesses and schools in the\\n                  region, this is a new and complex issue. \\n\\n                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \\nappetite for power --\\n                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The \\nfacilities run 24 hours a\\n                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a \\nconstant revenue\\n                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that \\nthey could\\n                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \\nexpenditures. \\n\\n                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will \\nmean for power rates\\n                  in the area is still open to debate. \\n\\n                       \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense \\nloads,\" said Bob Royer,\\n                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle \\nCity Light. \\n\\n                       \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium \\nlights at the football\\n                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. \\nWe have data\\n                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 \\nand 50 megawatts.\" \\n\\n                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate \\ncomplex in Tukwila is\\n                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased \\nthe 1.35 million\\n                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from \\nBoeing Space &\\n                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased \\n92 percent of the\\n                  six-building complex to seven different co-location \\ncompanies. \\n\\n                       \"It is probably the largest data center park in the \\ncountry,\" boasts Laurent\\n                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG \\nCommunications,\\n                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama \\nNetworks all\\n                  lease space in the office park. \\n\\n                       After building Exodus\\' first Tukwila facility in 1997, \\nSabey has become an\\n                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under \\nmanagement or\\n                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole \\nclaims his firm is\\n                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \\nthe country. \\n\\n                       As more people access the Internet and conduct \\nbandwidth-heavy tasks\\n                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \\nco-location space in\\n                  Seattle continues to escalate. \\n\\n                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \\nspace is growing at a\\n                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \\ncausing similar\\n                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \\nCalifornia. \\n\\n                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \\nspace, plans to nearly\\n                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \\nWhile companies\\n                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \\nhigh-tech companies\\n                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \\nas Exodus that\\n                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \\nmanagement. \\n\\n                       \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \\nconstruction and we plan to\\n                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \\ndemand right now\\n                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \\nexecutive at Exodus in\\n                  Seattle. \\n\\n                       The booming market for co-location space has left some \\nin the local utility\\n                  industry perplexed. \\n\\n                       \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \\nto serve the growth,\"\\n                  said Seattle City Light\\'s Royer. \"The utility industry is \\nalmost stunned by this, in\\n                  a way.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Now that we have had several traders \\nmanaging transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss \\nany issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu \\n(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they \\nwill be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this \\nmeeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is \\ncomfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those \\nwho are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have \\nheard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to \\ndiscuss them.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you are unable to attend.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

The \\nWSCC data, which is dicey and we don\\'t have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \\nwhich comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \\nthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \\nthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \\ngeneration.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn\\'t schedule their \\ngeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \\nwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \\nmunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \\nif they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \\nschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \\nall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \\nthe generation side.\\n\\nOn the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \\nthey don\\'t split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \\nbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \\nload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\\n\\nI think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \\nothers up here once you have it finished.  I\\'d like to see how much gas \\ndemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \\nespecially compared to all gas consumption.

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \\nan issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is \\nO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to \\nget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \\nI'll take care of it..\\n\\nOn PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \\ncurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \\n$235,019.   \\n(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \\noverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \\nsomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \\n#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\\n  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)\\n  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)\\n  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)\\n  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)\\n  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)\\n Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \\nGDP-Kingsgate.\\n\\n Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \\ndifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \\nwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a \\nQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is \\nthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \\nlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  \\nI'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \\nsystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems \\nthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \\nthe transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the \\ndetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it \\nappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be \\nan operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar \\nimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in \\ncase there's something you want to do about it.

Who are your main \\ncontacts at SW Gas?\\n\\nWe will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our \\ncontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably \\nhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the \\ncommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \\ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \\nshould look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \\nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \\nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \\ntheir PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.\\n\\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are \\nthere elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly \\nappreciated.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nLaird\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Our\\nproject\\n> is rather large 2900 sq ft SB house with 1800 sq ft porch surrounding it.\\nLot's\\n> of cement approx. 160 sq yds. After looking at the costs we changed our\\nminds\\n> rather quickly.\\n>\\n> Labor for Stamping Crew $2500.00\\n> Davis Color Stain 4lbs per yd x 100 yds x $18 lb $7200.00\\n>\\n> These are above and beyond the cost of the concrete.\\n>\\n> Actual Result: Took a truck and trailer to Mexico and handpicked Sautillo\\ntiles\\n> for inside the house. Changed the color of the cement on the porch to 1lb\\nper yd\\n> mix color, added the overrun tiles we had left over as stringers in the\\nporch\\n> and accented with acid etched stain.\\n>\\n> Tiles and Transportation $3000.00\\n> Labor, mastic and beer. tile setting (did it myself) $1400.00\\n> Acid Stain for porch $ 350.00\\n> Davis Pigment $15 x 40 yds $ 600.00\\n>\\n> I can get you the info on the stain if you like, I ordered it from a\\ncompany the\\n> web, can't remember off hand who. I ordered a sample kit for $35.00 which\\nhas 7\\n> colors you can mix and match for the results you want. It was easy to work\\nwith\\n> much like painting in water colors on a large scale.\\n>\\n> Hope this helps you out,\\n>\\n> Matt Kizziah\\n>\",\n",

Any possibility for a \\ndeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans \\nand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is \\nreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and \\nDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the \\nbonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into \\nthe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and \\nthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of \\nthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  \\nAdditionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term \\npower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the \\nbond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of \\ncontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge \\nloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very \\ndifficult.\\n\\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state \\nwould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General \\nFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 \\nbillion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this \\nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full \\ndisclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the \\ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they \\nwill support the bond issuance to go forward.\\n\\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB \\n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill \\npassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of \\nRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for \\ncommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be \\namended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, \\ncurrently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state should \\nget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be \\nlikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \\n \\nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, \\nRepublicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money \\navailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated \\nthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  \\nOther Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The \\nRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, \\nLehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and \\nthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\\n \\nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\\nInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 B\\nLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B\\n   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B\\n   Bear Stearns  $625 M\\nTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\\nProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%\\n   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%\\nCurrent Projected \\nBlended IR:  5.38%\\nMaturity Date:  August 29, 2001\\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\\n\\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the \\nCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion \\nauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be \\nauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the \\nadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing \\npower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these \\nauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the \\ngovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond \\namount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to \\nsupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB \\n6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  \\nfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  \\nthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  \\nbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this \\nidea  earlier in the crisis.\\n \\nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The \\nfirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the \\ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is \\nAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According \\nto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has \\nsigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis \\nand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates \\nthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary \\nbankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \\n\\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond \\nissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) \\nstating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, \\nthen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the \\nstate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and \\npassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for \\nbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and \\nthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.\\n\\n',\n",

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \\nMarch 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \\nover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \\ntemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \\ninto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \\ncompared with the previous year.\\n\\nLooking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \\nreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \\nforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \\ntotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \\nThis scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \\nmore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \\ndecrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \\nretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \\nis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \\nyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \\nJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \\nare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \\nmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \\neconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \\nmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\\n\\nNote that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \\nonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \\n(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \\nportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \\ndemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \\nyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \\nsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \\nleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \\nwish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \\nmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \\nsharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \\nhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \\nOther large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif\\'s \\neconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \\nthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \\nthink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \\nrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \\nnon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \\nWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \\n6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\\n\\nI am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you \\nwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I \\nhope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \\nquestions or need any further information.\\n',\n",

Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The \\ncost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is \\ncurrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly \\nemployee cost of $94.00.\\n\\nIf you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to \\nthe Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made \\nas spaces become available. \\n\\nThe Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be \\nopened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street \\nlevel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. \\nGarage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an \\nexit in the event of elevator trouble. \\n\\nIf you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to \\nParking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your \\nemail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and \\nreceive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new \\ngarage.\\n\\nThe Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and \\nTransportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. \\n\\n(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, \\nwill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia\\nHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest\\nregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid\\nabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.\\nBut that still wasn\\'t enough juice.\\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts\\nof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of\\n$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts\\nof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the\\n$250/MWh price cap.\\nThe LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The\\nmunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power\\ninto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP\\nis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit\\nclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville\\nPower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the\\nmarket at prices 10 times higher.\\nPowerex officials wouldn\\'t comment on the ISO power sale, saying all\\ntransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000\\nmegawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts\\n- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.\\nThe ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state\\nno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,\\nwhich means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having\\nto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing\\nto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.\\nThe ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during\\na conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency\\nWednesday, but wouldn\\'t order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared\\nwhen the ISO\\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is\\ninterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.\\nBut ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as\\na means of attracting additional electricity resources.\\n\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"\\nDorinson said.\\nEdison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy\\nunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &\\nElectric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of\\nthe high-priced power.\\nSoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high\\nwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by\\nnearly $1 billion, analysts said.

They were taken down\\ntwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality\\nManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,\\nThomas said.\\nAES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire\\nHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos\\nand Redondo Beach plants.\\nThe ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES\\nhas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the\\ncompany $20 million for polluting.\\n\"We\\'d be happy to put our units back, provided we don\\'t get sued for it,\"\\nThomas said. \"It\\'s not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality\\ndistrict\\'s\" authority.\\nAs reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES\\ncould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off\\nline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.\\n\\n   Dynegy\\'s El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC\\n\\nDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday\\nevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line\\nWednesday.\\n\"I guess our position is, \\'Gee, we\\'re sorry you don\\'t believe us, but if you\\nneed to come and take a look for yourself, that\\'s fine,\\'\" said Dynegy\\nspokesman Lynn Lednicky.\\nLednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and\\nthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could\\npose a safety hazard if not repaired.\\n\"We\\'ve been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"We\\neven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"\\nLednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy\\'s explanation of\\nwhy its units were off line.\\n-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,\\njessica.berthold@dowjones.com\\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\\n1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\\n\\n\\nG_nther A.
