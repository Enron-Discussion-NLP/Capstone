As you know, I am not \\n     supposed to do an investment for you while you are a resident of the \\n     US. I have discovered that if we put the money into an account and not \\n     make moves on it until you move back to Canada, then we can do it if I \\n     use a Canadian address. I was advised to put the money into a balanced \\n     fund and leave it there for now. My thoughts are to move it to a \\n     couple of funds in a self administered account and NOT make any moves \\n     with it. \\n     \\n     Please review this note, and let me know what you think. If all is ok \\n     I will mail you the forms to sign (which you signed here), and we will \\n     get this moving.\\n     \\n     Hope all is well with you down there.\\n     \\n     Regards\\n     Rob\\n'"
