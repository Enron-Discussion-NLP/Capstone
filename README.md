# Getting Ahead of the Headline | Enron Topic Modeling
Analyzing employee emails using Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, and Time Series Analysis

# Project Description
<p>In this unsupervised machine learning project we are exploring and analyzing Enron employee emails. We are using topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis to identify trends in communication themes over time. For our MVP we are looking at a corpus of 5,575 emails sent by people of interest, as identified by the official congressional report on the role of Enron's board of directors (https://bit.ly/3Hjz5rI) on the collapse of the company. 

<p>Our initial hypothesis is that there will be uniquely identifiable trends in email topics over time and that organizations will be able to use our analysis to identify key themes in communication between persons of interest in the early stages of investigating suspicious organizational activity.

## Background
[insert Enron blurb here]

## Business Goal
In our current professional climate, employers have realized the value in prioritizing employee morale and the impact that it has on the health of their companies. Our model can be employed by stakeholders looking to determine the health of their company and get ahead of any internal vulnerabilities before they become larger problems. 

## Initial Hypothesis
Our initial hypothesis is that trends in employee morale can be used to predict internal weaknesses and problem areas within a company.

# Data Science Pipeline 

## Planning
We used a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/osnQZqjJ/enronnlp-project) for planning.

## Data Wrangling
Data source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset), Will Cukierski | 2016 

## Exploratory Analysis
1. Are there any unique trends across department in sentiment scores? (additional data >> employee by department)
2. Are employees happy? What can we learn by analyzing emails?
3. Is there anything unique about emails in deleted items?
4. Are there any seasonal trends in the email sentiments?
5. Is there a pattern in the sentiment analysis of the email?
6. Do certain senders have sentiment scores that change over time?
7. Do certain recipients have sentiment scores that change over time?
8. Do certain file paths have higher/lower average sentiment scores?
9. Do certain authors have higher/lower average sentiment scores?
