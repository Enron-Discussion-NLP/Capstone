Analyzing Company Emails to Identify Trends in Employee Morale

# Project Description
For this project we are building an morale sentiment scoring model. We are working with Enron employee email data from [insert date range] and exploring trends in morale as the company was collapsing by analyzing sentiment scores. 

## Background
[insert Enron blurb here]

## Business Goal
In our current professional climate, employers have realized the value in prioritizing employee morale and the impact that it has on the health of their companies. Our model can be employed by stakeholders looking to determine the health of their company and get ahead of any internal vulnerabilities before they become larger problems. 

## Initial Hypothesis
Our initial hypothesis is that trends in employee morale can be used to predict internal weaknesses and problem areas within a company.

## Data Wrangling

## Exploratory Analysis
1. Are there any unique trends across department in sentiment scores? (additional data >> employee by department)
2. Are employees happy? What can we learn by analyzing emails?
3. Is there anything unique about emails in deleted items?
4. Are there any seasonal trends in the email sentiments?
5. Is there a pattern in the sentiment analysis of the email?
6. Do certain senders have sentiment scores that change over time?
7. Do certain recipients have sentiment scores that change over time?
8. Do certain file paths have higher/lower average sentiment scores?
9. Do certain authors have higher/lower average sentiment scores?
